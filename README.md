# Supply Chain Optimization
The main objective of the task is to minimize the overall cost while satisfying customer demand and adhering to operational constraints.

## Pre-Requisite
1) Python: Install Python.

## Installation
1) Clone the repo, create and activate the environment for the project.
2) Install all required packages from requirements.txt file using command: "pip install -r requirements.txt"

## Usage
1) Run the jupyter notebook file to fetch data and do initial data preprocessing and cleaning.
2) To start the app, run command: "streamlit run supply_chain_optimization.py"
3) From "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)" page, do basic EDA to analyse the extracted data.
4) From "Advanced Analysis" page, get general insights about the extracted and optimized supply chain data.

## Features
1) Setting up Streamlit app: Using Streamlit application to create a simple UI.
2) Data Cleaning and Preparation: Using Pandas to preprocess the data (managing missing values, etc).
3) Exploratory Data Analysis: Doing basic EDA to analyse the extracted data to get initial insights and finding out patterns from the data.
4) Advanced Analysis And Dashboard Creation: Plotted various charts and figures on the streamlit UI and to get detailed insights on the extracted and optimized supply chain data.
